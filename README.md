## Development Workflow

For the development workflow, the team as decided to follow a new feature logic.

Each time an addition needs to be made to the code in the master branch, a new branch
is to be created with a meaningful that incorporates the nature of the change and
the name and number of the corresponding task in Jira, for example:
  - feature/Login-11 (this task is a feature, Login, and is task number 11 in Jira)
  - docs/Meeting_Notes_Sep_2 (this is a document, meeting notes from September second)
  - bug/Fix_Login-24 (this task is a bug fix on the login feature, and is task number 24 in Jira)

For each commit, the Conventional Commits standards (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) must be followed.
